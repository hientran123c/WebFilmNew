[Music]

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The body that can catch the disappearing scoop

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The sky is still dark

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The stopped clock is a machine that doesn't ring

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My voice can't reach

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is my curse

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The depth of the sin I committed

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Your wish

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My defiled soul

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know what to do

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, we are now

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Screaming at that value

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The song of that broken world

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, we are now

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I wish in that sense

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Just the future with you

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The smile of that day

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Disappeared with love

[Music]

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The green overflows

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The life spills

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The wind is still far away

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The rust that peels off

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The blade that grumbles

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In the forest where the dead are hidden

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is my curse

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The pain of killing promises

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your wish

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I threw away my last dream

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not good, but

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, we are now

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Screaming at that value

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The love of this dirty world

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, we are now

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I wish in that sense

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just the time with you

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The consciousness that fell

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Disappeared with kindness

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, we are now

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Screaming at that value

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The song of that broken world

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, we are now

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I wish in that sense

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just the future with you

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, we are now

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Screaming at that value

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The love of this dirty world

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, we are now

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I wish in that sense

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Just the time with you

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Even if prayer cannot be forgiven

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I am
