00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The Tower of the Moon

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.500
This tower is a giant cannon that aims at the human server on the moon

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
At this rate, the remaining data of humanity will be destroyed

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hahaha... It doesn't matter... It doesn't matter anymore...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Did you know? We don't need this world

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Humanity is already destroyed

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.000
The Moon's disguised server was created to make Android fight

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The Yorha unit was prepared to protect that lie

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was planned to be destroyed from the beginning for the destruction of evidence

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The backdoor set up by the bunker was activated at a certain time

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The commander, me, and 2B...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Everything was a waste

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's funny, isn't it? It's funny, isn't it?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
9S... We...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You killed 2B, didn't you?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's enough

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The reason we kill each other...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
2B was suffering

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You...

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
To keep killing

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
9S type of high-performance model was expected to reach the truth

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Her model name 2B is a fake

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The real name of the model is...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The official name is...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
2E...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
2E type of high-performance model

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The unit was prepared to execute the Yorha unit

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You've already noticed, haven't you?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
9S...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Shut up...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Shut up!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What do you know about us?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The command "Stop the battle. Do not speak to her here."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I command POD No.1!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Do not speak or think about your own logic!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This command is...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Hold it until I can confirm the stop of either A2 or my life activities!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I will not let you die!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Hehe...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I don't care anymore, Tenbu!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
9S!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Why do I miss humans so much?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Why do I want to touch humans even though they're gone?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's because they're made!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We androids are made to protect humanity!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That basic program is our heart!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I just have to...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I just have to lose everything!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Damn!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
9S...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Please...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Tenbu...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'm sorry...

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm sorry...
