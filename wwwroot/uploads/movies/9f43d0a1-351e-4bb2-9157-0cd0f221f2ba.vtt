00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000
[Music]

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The body that can catch the disappearing scoop

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The sky is still dark

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The stopped clock is a machine that doesn't ring

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
My voice can't reach

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is my curse

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The depth of the sin I committed

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Your wish

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
My defiled soul

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't know what to do

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Yes, we are now

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Screaming at that value

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The song of that broken world

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yes, we are now

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I wish in that sense

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Just the future with you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The smile of that day

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Disappeared with love

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Music]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The green overflows

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The life spills

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The wind is still far away

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The rust that peels off

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The blade that grumbles

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In the forest where the dead are hidden

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is my curse

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The pain of killing promises

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Your wish

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I threw away my last dream

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's not good, but

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yes, we are now

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Screaming at that value

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The love of this dirty world

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Yes, we are now

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I wish in that sense

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Just the time with you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The consciousness that fell

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Disappeared with kindness

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:16.000
[Music]

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Yes, we are now

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Screaming at that value

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The song of that broken world

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes, we are now

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I wish in that sense

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Just the future with you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Yes, we are now

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Screaming at that value

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The love of this dirty world

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Yes, we are now

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I wish in that sense

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Just the time with you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Even if prayer cannot be forgiven

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Music]

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I am

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:40.000
