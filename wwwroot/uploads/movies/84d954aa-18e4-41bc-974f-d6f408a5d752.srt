1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Tower of the Moon

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,500
This tower is a giant cannon that aims at the human server on the moon

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,000
At this rate, the remaining data of humanity will be destroyed

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hahaha... It doesn't matter... It doesn't matter anymore...

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Did you know? We don't need this world

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Humanity is already destroyed

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,000
The Moon's disguised server was created to make Android fight

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The Yorha unit was prepared to protect that lie

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was planned to be destroyed from the beginning for the destruction of evidence

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The backdoor set up by the bunker was activated at a certain time

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The commander, me, and 2B...

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Everything was a waste

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's funny, isn't it? It's funny, isn't it?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
9S... We...

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You killed 2B, didn't you?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's enough

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The reason we kill each other...

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
2B was suffering

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You...

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
To keep killing

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
9S type of high-performance model was expected to reach the truth

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Her model name 2B is a fake

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The real name of the model is...

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The official name is...

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
2E...

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
2E type of high-performance model

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The unit was prepared to execute the Yorha unit

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You've already noticed, haven't you?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
9S...

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Shut up...

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shut up!

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What do you know about us?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The command "Stop the battle. Do not speak to her here."

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I command POD No.1!

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do not speak or think about your own logic!

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This command is...

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hold it until I can confirm the stop of either A2 or my life activities!

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will not let you die!

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hehe...

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't care anymore, Tenbu!

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
9S!

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But...

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why do I miss humans so much?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why do I want to touch humans even though they're gone?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's because they're made!

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We androids are made to protect humanity!

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That basic program is our heart!

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I just have to...

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I just have to lose everything!

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Damn!

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
9S...

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please...

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tenbu...

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry...

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry...

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry...

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry...

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry...

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry...

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry...

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry...

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry...

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry...

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry...

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry...

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry...

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry...

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry...

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry...

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry...

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry...

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry...

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry...

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry...

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry...

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry...

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry...

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry...

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry...

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry...

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry...

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry...

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry...
